* Curate a hashtag
** There is a hashtag we wish to curate to our own Curated X stream
*** We need a twitter account for each hashtag
**** It should be automatically created at some point.
*** We designate a hashtag
**** Object: The Curation Stream
***** Use a web-page as the first object
****** title:
****** description:
***** hashtag:
***** twitter-account:
***** oauth key:
**** Add hash-tag
**** List/browse/search hash-tags
** We are users authorized to edit the info
*** 1ST: single login
*** then: different logins for audit/attribution/segmentation
*** then: groups for teams to edit
*** then: roles for each action... (use caps)
*** Object: User descriptive-name, openid
**** gravatar
**** Manual user-add
**** then, user-add by "su"
**** 
** Certain twits are trusted to provide tweets on the hashtag
*** hashtag.add-twit, suspend-twit, delete-twit
*** check for twit on add for sanity
*** advise on use of hashtag, for further sanity
*** then confirm (workflow)
** We want a workflow to handle twits
*** candidate, reject, active
*** make the workflow configurable..
*** Dashboard page shows things to take action on
**** A user only wants to see certain workstates (per curation-stream)
** We retweet them to our stream: The Curated X
*** periodically (10minutes) we check for our hashtag in good-twits.
*** and retweet to our stream X
** Anyone can nominate a twit.
*** Use twitter to nominate: 
**** #hashtagx-nominate @xxx
**** @curatedstream blahblah @xxx
*** The nominee should agree to use the hashtag
**** How? Force confirmed visit to our site?
** Established twits use their own tag
*** Add "alias" to our hashtag for a twit
** We should discover other twits using the hashtag well & trust them
*** Search for #hashtag, filter out accepted-twits. group by twit
*** Add "candidate" button to add as candidate
** We should provide a recent-history of the stream: rss or just twitter?
*** Twitter to start
*** Atom later (format)
** We should hand out biz cards for the hashtag at cool events
*** To the organizers, promoters, performers, etc.
** Put up guerilla posters for the stream.
** A particular stream should be a member of a family of streams.
*** e.g. cool-events is part of Baltimore
** Spread to other locales, etc.
** Put in some sanity checking to prevent catastrophes
*** When retweeting, limit to n (10 at a time?)
*** Notice if a twit has too many (10/day?)
** All these parameters are per-curation-stream
